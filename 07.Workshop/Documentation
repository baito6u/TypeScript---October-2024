The app is a Single Page Application (SPA) using TypeScript with Vite, implementing basic CRUD operations with the JSONPlaceholder API. 
The goal is to practice TypeScript concepts like typing, services, and error handling.

Full Application Overview:
PostsService.ts and UsersService.ts handle the CRUD operations with the API.
HtmlRenderer.ts is a reusable class for rendering any data dynamically.
Posts.ts and Users.ts use the services and the renderer to display the data from the API.
Router.ts handles the navigation between posts and users.
This approach ensures that your app is modular, and you can easily reuse the HtmlRenderer class across different components.
